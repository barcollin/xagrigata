#Xagrigata

Xagrigata is designed to streamline and aggregate event subscriptions from multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos). It provides developers with a unified interface for listening to and processing real-time events across different blockchain ecosystems.

## Features:

* **Multi-chain Support** - easily subscribe to blockchain events from multiple networks simultaneously, including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and Cosmos
* **Event Aggregation** - Collect and aggregate various types of blockchain events, such as smart contract interactions, token transfers, and custom event logs, into a single channel for easy processing.
* **Custom Event Filters** - Filter events based on specific criteria (e.g., contract address, event type) to focus only on relevant blockchain activities
* **Concurrent Event Processing** - Leverages Goâ€™s concurrency model to handle multiple blockchain event subscriptions in parallel, ensuring fast and efficient event handling
* **Resilient Connections** - Automatically manages reconnections to blockchain nodes in case of dropped connections or network issues, ensuring continuous event monitoring.
* **Modular Architecture** - Each blockchain integration is separated into its own module, making the package extensible and allowing additional blockchain networks to be easily added.

## Use Case:

* **DeFi Platforms** - Monitor token swaps, liquidity pool interactions, and staking events across different blockchains.
* **NFT Marketplaces** - Track minting, transfers, and sales of NFTs from multiple chains.
* **Cross-chain Applications** - Aggregate events from different blockchains to support cross-chain functionality and interoperability.
* **Analytics & Reporting** - Collect event data for blockchain analytics dashboards or reporting tools.
